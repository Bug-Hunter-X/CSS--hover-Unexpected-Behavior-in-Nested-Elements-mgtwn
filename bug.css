The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue with unexpected behavior when using the `:hover` pseudo-class within a nested element structure.  The inner element's hover style is unexpectedly affecting the outer element.

```css
.outer {
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 20px;
}

.inner {
  background-color: lightcoral;
  padding: 10px;
}

.outer:hover .inner {
  background-color: lightgreen; /*This should only affect the inner element on hover*/
}

.inner:hover {
  background-color: yellow; /*This works as expected*/
}
```

The issue is that hovering over `.inner` will change the background color of `.outer` to lightgreen, which is not the intended behavior. Only `.inner`'s background should change to yellow on hover; `.outer` should remain lightblue unless explicitly hovered over.

This is an uncommon error because it relies on a specific nesting and the interplay between parent and child selectors. It often stems from misunderstanding CSS specificity and how the cascade operates.
